## About

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Victoria ([UVIC](https://www.uvic.ca/)), working with [Dr. Teseo Schneider](http://web.uvic.ca/~teseo/) . Prior to this, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science from New York University ([NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/)) and B.Eng. in Electronic Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications ([BUPT](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/)). Previously, I have interned at Microsoft Research Asia ([MSRA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/)). 

My current research focuses on computer graphics, physics-based simulation, geometry processing, particularly on learning-based paradigms to enhance simulations.
